# The Last Signal - Development Notes

## Project Overview
An AI-powered text adventure game set on an abandoned space station. The player wakes from cryosleep to find most of the crew dead and must uncover what happened while interacting with fragmented AI personalities.

## Key Features
- OpenAI GPT-4o integration for dynamic AI character responses
- Four distinct AI personalities (ARIA, ECHO, NOVA, SAGE)
- Retro CRT terminal aesthetic
- Ink.js story engine
- Save/load system

## Server Issues & Resolution

### The Problem
The Vite development server would appear to start but wasn't actually accessible on localhost. The terminal showed "ready" but browsers couldn't connect.

### The Solution
1. Kill all existing node processes: `killall node`
2. Start Vite in background mode: `nohup npm run dev > /tmp/vite.log 2>&1 &`
3. Verify it's actually running: `curl -I http://localhost:5173/`
4. Access via http://127.0.0.1:5173/ if localhost doesn't work

### Why This Happened
- Multiple node processes were conflicting
- Vite was starting but immediately dying when run in foreground
- Running in background with nohup kept it alive

## How to Start the Game

### Development
```bash
cd /Users/chasedillingham/last-signal/the-last-signal
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Starting a New Game
The game should automatically start when loaded. To begin the story, the player should type:
- `begin`
- `new game`
- `start`
- `wake up`

## Environment Setup
The OpenAI API key is stored in `.env`:
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
VITE_AI_MODEL=gpt-4o
```

## Game Status - WORKING!
The game is now fully functional with the following fixes implemented:
- API key successfully loads from .env file
- Story loads properly using a simplified Ink structure without knot navigation
- Game accepts common start commands and begins the story appropriately
- All core features are operational

## Key Solution
The main issue was with the Ink story structure. By simplifying the story to avoid complex knot navigation and using a more linear approach, the game now loads and runs smoothly. The API integration works correctly, allowing dynamic AI conversations with the four distinct personalities.
